Yes, I'm aware we have photographs and videos. And perhaps in the near future we will have virtual reality files where we can relive our memories in a near physical way. But until that comes to fruition, music is the most effective way for me to relive exactly how I felt at a certain moment in time. Photographs are too instantaneous. Videos are many photos stiched together to create a longer snippet. However, music can be stretched across days and weeks. Music is an amorphous blob. There's that song you heard on the radio a lot that one summer. When you hear it again, you dig up an entire summer's worth of emotions, events, and interactions.
