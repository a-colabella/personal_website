Rays of morning sunlight pierced through the curtains. The alarm was ringing from across the room. I rolled out of bed and my feet touched the cold floor of my cuboidal apartment. After turning off the alarm, I walked over to the closet and stared at seven identical gray outfits. There’s a set of pants and a button down shirt for each day of the week. I picked out the first set and got dressed.

I’m still getting used to life here in heaven. Back when I was alive and living on earth, people told me all these things about pearly gates and lush green gardens. It’s not quite like that.
First of all, there is no such thing as food in heaven. There is no need for it as we are never hungry. No food, no restaurants, no bars, no toilets. And everyone has a job in heaven. Don’t expect to come here and do nothing. You’re assigned a job based on the talents, or lack thereof, you held back home on earth. Everyone is given one square dormitorium to be their own.

So after I got dressed, I hurried downstairs and outside. The streets were filled with people flowing like conflicting currents. These people got places to be. It’s a fast paced world up here and there’s no time to be wasted.

My job was to report to the wall. The one I’m talking about is the mile high concrete wall that wraps around the entirety of heaven. It may be daunting in appearance, but a closer look reveals fractures and scars. The wall has one purpose: to keep those who didn’t make it to heaven out. As you might imagine, not making it to heaven is a serious thing. This is the afterlife which, unlike regular life, is infinite. It lasts forever. If you don’t make it to heaven, you’re stuck. Sorry, pal.

Getting rejected from heaven can spark intense emotional reactions in people. Everyone wants to come here, but only those who are qualified are allowed in. The man in charge is very selective.
Every day, I come to the wall and scale a long treacherous ladder to then climb to the other side of the wall. That’s correct,

I go to the other side. Why? Well, to clean it. The other side of the wall, the one that’s facing the void nothingness that isn’t heaven, is littered with graffiti and vandalism. There are cracks and wounds left over from all the people who couldn’t get in and were very angry about that. Every time someone gets rejected, their immediate reaction is to throw a tantrum and pound and kick against the wall. Others write profane words and slurs. And some spend days dousing the surface of the concrete with violent colors. I have to scrub it all off. The man in charge likes to keep it clean.

“Did you hear about the new guy?” my boss asked me.
I shrugged my shoulders. Apparently there’s a new guy in our group. I saw my coworkers traversing over to the wall, and near the front of the pack was a chipper looking guy with a smile that filled his face. He clearly just died. This had to be his first or second day in heaven. They always arrive cheery and excited.
“What are you gonna have him do?” I asked.
“Well, everybody hates scrubbing those dick drawings. So I figured I’d make him do it for his first day. That’ll set him straight”.
