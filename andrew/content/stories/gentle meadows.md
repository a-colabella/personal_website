The kids are inside and it’s a beautiful day. The streets are quiet in the monotony of suburbia. I sit on the pavement of a dilapidated public basketball court listening to someone’s dog bark at me from a window. The asphalt is rough, filled with craters, and cracked like the scene of a miniature earthquake. Lush and unrelenting green grass seeps through the cavernous cracks in the ground. Nature tried to reclaim its dominion over this man-made structure. The white lines that divide the court are fading into nonexistence.
